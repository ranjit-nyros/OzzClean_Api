Good Evening Sir,

To Client:
==========

We have configured applications(DBMap, MobiTracking, MobiAccount and ToolkitFramework) in new instance and also redirected the apps with their domains.

Thanks,
Team


To Client:
==========

We have 5 remote databases in DBMap applications, that we need remote access for those in the new instance to access.

Once we get remote access we will synchronize those databases to get all data in this new instance application.

We are attaching details of remote databases with their ip's.

Could you please check with Bhumish regrding remote access.

Thanks,
Team.
